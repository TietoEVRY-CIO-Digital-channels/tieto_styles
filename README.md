## Style Guide
Style guide is generated by SC5 styleguide generator and its files reside in '/style-guide'.

### Development
To develop the style guide type 'npm start' it will open up a server on port localhost:3000.

The development process is based on the SC5 styleguide tool, so the files located in folder "styles-library" need to be developed in tandem with the styleguide definition files located in folder "style-guide". The gude watches all SCSS files an changes/ reloads accordingly.

### Build
To build the style guide type 'gulp styleguide' it will build the guide into the 'docs' folder.
